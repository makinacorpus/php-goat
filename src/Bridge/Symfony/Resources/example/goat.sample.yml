        # Set this to true to enable concurrent processing of the same command
        # enabled.
        #
        # This will only block concurrent processing of commands implementing the
        # \Goat\Dispatcher\Message\UnparallelizableMessage interface.

        with_lock: false

        #
        # Set this to plug event store on the dispatcher: every processed
        # command will be stored into the event store.
        #
        # Use this if your application does not segregate commands vs domain
        # events (CQS but not CQRS) and you wish to log every incomming command
        # and their execution status in your system.
        #
        # If event store is not enabled, this will raise errors.
        #

        #
        # Profiling simply store command process time in milliseconds within
        # the message envelope properties.
        #
        # If you plug the event store altogether, timings will be stored in the
        # event store stored event properties as well, allowing you to analyze
        # performance restrospectively.

        # Retry logic will attempt to guess if a message is suitable for retry
        # in case of failure (for example, SQL serialization errors should be
        # retried).
        #
        # It will work only on messages that are asynchronously dispatched, not
        # for synchronously processed messages, to avoid UI glitches.

        # they will be all or nothing (including event store). In case of any
        # failure, everything will be rollbacked.
