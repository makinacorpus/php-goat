        # Enable the custom event dispatcher.

        with_logging: true

        #
        # Set this to true to enable concurrent processing of the same command
        # enabled.
        #
        # This will only block concurrent processing of commands implementing the
        # \Goat\Dispatcher\Message\UnparallelizableMessage interface.
        #
        with_lock: false

        #
        # Set this to plug event store on the dispatcher: every processed
        # command will be stored into the event store.
        #
        # Use this if your application does not segregate commands vs domain
        # events (CQS but not CQRS) and you wish to log every incomming command
        # and their execution status in your system.
        #
        # If event store is not enabled, this will raise errors.
        #
        with_event_store: false

        #
        # Profiling simply store command process time in milliseconds within
        # the message envelope properties.
        #
        # If you plug the event store altogether, timings will be stored in the
        # event store stored event properties as well, allowing you to analyze
        # performance restrospectively.

        with_profiling: true

        # Retry logic will attempt to guess if a message is suitable for retry
        # in case of failure (for example, SQL serialization errors should be
        # retried).
        #
        # It will work only on messages that are asynchronously dispatched, not
        # for synchronously processed messages, to avoid UI glitches.
        #
        # Retry logic can be customized by decorating or replacing the
        # 'goat.dispatcher.retry_strategy' service.
        #
        with_retry: true

        #
        # Enable transaction support.
        #
        # Transaction will decorate all other dispatcher decorators, hence
        # they will be all or nothing (including event store). In case of any
        # failure, everything will be rollbacked.
        #
        # Default transaction level is SERIALIZABLE (level 4), beware of the
        # potential performance impact.

    lock:

        # Enable the lock service.

    monolog:
        #
        # Registers a custom monolog  formatter that will add process PID to
        # log output lines.
        #
        log_pid: true

        #
        # Force monolog to include stack traces into logs when appliable.
        # Set this to true implies we harcode within container configuration the
        # \Monolog\Formatter\LineFormatter::includeStacktraces() method call to
        # enable exception stack trace collection.
        #
        always_log_stacktrace: false

    normalization:
        #
        # PHP native type to normalized type name
        #
        # This is one very important yet missing symfony/serializer feature:
        #
        #   - While you code will evolve upon time passing, at some point you
        #     will eventually end up renaming your classes, or moving them
        #     around in other namespaces, this allows you to map legacy names.
        # 
        #   - While your platform evolve, and you start plugging new external
        #     components on the same message broker, you may want at some point
        #     want to normalize event names to a semantic business-relative
        #     codified names.
        #
        # In both cases, it decorates the symfony/serializer component and
        # transparently convert incomming normalized names to PHP native types
        # to avoid it exploding upon missing classes. It also removes you the
        # pain of developping custom normalizers after each code modification
        # you do.
        #
        # This maps incomming normalized names to PHP types, but it also serve
        # the same purpose the other way arround, you MUST NOT put duplicates
        # in there, use the 'aliases' option key for duplicates.
        #
        map:
            my_app.normalized_name: Php\Native\Type
            my_app.other_normalized_name: Php\Other\Native\Type

        #
        # Whereas each PHP native type may have only one valid normalized name
        # at a single point in time.
        #
        aliases:
            Php\Legacy\Name: Php\Native\Type
            Php\EvenMoreLegacy\Name: Php\Native\Type
            my_app.legacy_normalized_name: Php\Native\Type
            my_app.other_legacy_normalized_name: my_app.normalized_name

    preferences:
        #
        # Preferences - a key-value/registry like user configuration storage
        # that restitutes values as environement variable in your container.
        #
        enabled: false

        #
        # Define a schema.
        #
        # If you remove this, all repositories will work in YOLO mode, meaning
        # nothing will ever be validated not even value types, you may then use
        # this API for arbitrary value storage.
        #
        # In the opposite, by defining a schema, you enable type and allowed
        # values validation for what is going to be stored, and also enable
        # the PreferenceSchema component in your container, allowing you to
        # dynamically build forms.
        #
        schema:
