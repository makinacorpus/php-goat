 *
 *   - all dependency setters has been removed from the interface, compiler
 *     passes and extension are now smarter and inject those only in case
 *     it's necessary,
 *
 *   - dispatchEvent() method has been removed, nobody ever used it,
 *
 *   - dispatchCommand() have been removed from the interface, but the default
 *     implementation on AbstractDispatcher remains for transparent backward
 *     compatibility. Consider reverting to dispatch() method instead.
