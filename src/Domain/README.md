# Legacy namespace

Code in this directory will be dropped one day or the other:

 - `Generator` namespace should be rewrote completely,
 - `Messenger` will be moved into the `Bridge` namespace,
 - `Repository` will be kept for a while, but should not be used anymore,
 - `Serializer` will be moved into the `Bridge` namespace.
